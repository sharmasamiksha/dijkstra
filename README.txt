Current application has a GUI that loads a graph when a file is chosen. 
Once a file is chosen, cities are displayed for users to chose from and input them in start and end text field.
'Calculate Route' button then calculates shortest path from start to end using Dijkstra's algorithm. 
Also, graph is shown on screen and vertices are randomly placed on screen. Route can be calculated for any combination of start and end city.
